# Definition of Ready / Done

Every team an have their own DoR/DoD, but below is a guideline that you can start from. You should update this doc for
your project.

## Definition of Ready

The goal of the DoR is to provide a clear set of rules that the product owner and dev team must follow in order to be
able to consider bringing a piece of work into a sprint.

Bringing stories into a sprint that do **not** meet the DoR adds risk to your sprint (as this indicates that there is
still some "unknown"). Your team may certainly decide where exceptions should be made, but consider the risks and make
sure that the product owner is aware of (and accepts) those risks.

### Baseline

* The story includes clearly defined acceptance criteria
* The story is understood by everyone
* The story has been prioritised and sized (and broken down if it's too big)
* There are no impediments / no outstanding questions
* External and internal dependencies are known and available
* Designs are ready and signed off (where applicable)

## Definition of Done

Generally speaking, stories should never be re-opened (unless accidentally closed). The goal of each sprint should be
to get each story to a point where it meets the DoD, and can be closed.

* All acceptance criteria are met
* All agreed testing passed
* All tasks are marked as "complete" 
* Feature is deployed to agreed delivery environment
* All documentation is complete
