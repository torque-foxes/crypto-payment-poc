# Preinstalled modules

These are modules that are included by default in the project

## Debug bar
_[Repo](https://github.com/lekoala/silverstripe-debugbar)_

SilverStripe Debug Bar is a wrapper for PHP DebugBar which integrates with SilverStripe to provide more useful
information about your projects. The Debug Bar can help you to easily identify performance issues, analyse environment
settings and discover which parts of your code are being used.

For example, if your application is running the same database query multiple times in a loop, or a certain controller
action is taking a long time to run, Debug Bar will highlight these bottlenecks so you can take steps to improve your
overall site performance.
