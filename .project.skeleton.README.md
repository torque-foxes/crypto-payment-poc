## Installation

### Preamble

Older versions of `dev-ssp` are no longer supported. We recommend that you use version `1.3.2` or newer. If, for
whatever reason, you do not wish to upgrade your box, please see the
[Installation - Legacy](docs/installation-legacy.md)
docs. And also please understand that if you use an unsupported box, things might not work as expected.

If your project is upgrading from an older box to `> 1.3.0`, you might want to check out these notes on
[Installation - Upgrade](docs/installation-upgrade.md), which documents which configs you'll need to update.

### Set up local environment

All commands are to be run from the project root directory (unless otherwise specified).

Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (if you haven't already).

Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (if you haven't already).

Add our ssp Vagrant box:

```
$ vagrant box add silverstripeltd/dev-cwp
```

You can check which box you have as follows.

```
$ vagrant box list
silverstripeltd/dev-cwp (virtualbox, 1.2.0)
```

If you have an older box, you can upgrade as follows.

```
$ vagrant box update
silverstripeltd/dev-cwp (virtualbox, 1.3.2)
```

Prepare your Vagrantfile.

```
$ cp Vagrantfile.dist Vagrantfile
```

Prepare your Silverstripe environment file.

```
$ cp .env.dist .env
```

Open up your `.env` file, and update your IP, hostname, VM settings (if required).

```
# Vagrant Settings
IP_ADDRESS=192.168.33.4
HOSTNAME=myproject.test

# Optional settings below
#VM_MEMORY=2048
#VM_CPU=2
# Default disk size is 120GB
#VM_DISK_SIZE=140
```

You can either use the `vagrant-hostsupdater` plugin, or you can update your `/etc/hosts` file manually.

```
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

# Add line
192.168.33.4   myproject.test
```

Build your VM.
```
$ vagrant up
```

### Build steps:

The following steps can be run from within your VM (if you ssh into it), or from your local machine (if you have the
appropriate libraries available).

Run composer
```
$ composer install
```

Install yarn dependencies
```
$ yarn
```

You will need to ssh into your VM at this point (if you haven't already).

(Optional) Create a .vm_aliases file from .vm_aliases.dist
```
$ cp .vm_aliases.dist .vm_aliases
```

Run a dev/build
```
# Without alias
$ vendor/bin/sake dev/build flush=1

# With alias
$ dbf
```

## Changing PHP versions

The latest box will set PHP 7.4 by default. You might find that you need to use a lower version for some projects.

There is a known issue open for `php-switch`:
https://github.com/silverstripeltd/dev-boxes/issues/165

The workaround:
```
$ sudo -i
$ a2dismod php*
$ a2enmod php7.3
$ service apache2 restart
```

### Environment variables

- `SS_MFA_SECRET_KEY`: [Configure this](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-totp-authenticator#configuration)
to use multi factor authentication. Ensure you create encryption keys for UAT and Production on your Silverstripe Cloud
stack (These are generated automatically for CWP stacks). Note: If UAT/Prod have the same secret key, snapshotting
between environments allows CMS users to use the same MFA credentials.
- `DEBUGBAR_DISABLE`: Set this to `true` to disable silverstripe-debugbar.

## Available Build Tools

* `yarn` install dependencies
* `yarn dev` builds dev js and scss
* `yarn watch` same as `yarn dev` but watches for changes
* `yarn production` minifies production files
* `yarn prod` alias for `yarn production`
* `yarn lint` lints js and scss
* `yarn hot` **unsupported** hot module reloading

### Other tools and commands

* `composer silverstripe-standards` run all coding standards checks, including linters (php, js, scss)
* `composer phpcs-fix` run code-sniffer fixer
